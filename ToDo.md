Init particle so, that they don't overlap.
deltaTime should be different from dt in simulation.
- For example dt could be hardcoded 0.1s, whilde deltaTime is dynamic.
-- Makes this sense? If not think about another solution. For example is this deltaTime even necessary? And why? Write it down.
Make the code faster.
- use chrono library
Implement thread solution.
